## Feature-Sliced Architecture Rules

### 🧱 Layer Hierarchy
(app) → modules → widgets → features → entities → shared.

Layers (top → bottom):

### ✅ Allowed Imports
- (app) → modules, widgets, features, entities, shared  
- modules → widgets, features, entities, shared  
- widgets → features, entities, shared  
- features → entities, shared  
- entities → shared  
- shared → (no other layers)

### ❌ Forbidden Imports
- shared → entities, features, widgets, modules, (app)  
- entities → features, widgets, modules, (app)  
- features → widgets, modules, (app)  
- widgets → modules, (app)  
- modules → (app)

### 🧩 Behavior in Cursor
- Cursor AI and autocomplete **will suggest only allowed imports**.
- When you try to import from a higher layer, Cursor will **warn you** or **block the suggestion**.
- You can still override manually, but it helps you stay consistent with Feature-Sliced Design.
- Works best when folder names match exactly (`src/app`, `src/modules`, etc.).
